# Liquid-Handler

Welcome to the github page for the SideKick liquid handler! This project is currently in the prototype stage, so forgive the sparsity in documentation. More in depth guides will be posted as the build continues. For now, all the code to run and build the liquid handler is available, but the circuitry diagram is not yet up. We're currently sourcing new stepper drivers, and once the electronics are all squared away, we'll post that info as well.
