# Liquid-Handler

Welcome to the github page for the SideKick liquid handler! This project is is nearing the end of the prototype phase, and is beginning testing. We're working on all of the final documentation so that anyone can print their own SideKick. Right now, if you'd like to get started with building, there is an assembly guide located in the "Supporting Documentation" folder. This currently covers the mechanical assembly, the wiring, and getting started with the SideKick's software. The source code for the SideKick is located in the "Pico Snapshot" folder, just flash it onto a Pico running Micropython. The SideKick has its own custom PCB, the zip folder for manufacturing can be found in the "PCB" folder. 

Right now, we are working on a finalized code for the main loop so that it can be commanded via serial port, finished documentation on 3D-printing the parts, and a posted library of commands.
