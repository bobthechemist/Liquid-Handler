Pump Adapter V2 is the updated tubing adapter. Until I get around to making more detailed instructions, this text file should help in assembly.

1). The Adapter works with the Pump Adapter V2 mount. Mount each pump first, and then attach the larger diameter tubing (the old outer tubing sleeves) onto each of the pumps inlet and outlet ports.

2). Sleeve the smaller diameter tubing into the larger diameter tubing, just like with the old design. However! Push the smaller tubing in until it contacts the pump itself.

3.) Place the whole assembly on its side, and rest it onto one of the pump adapter clamps. The clamps are NOT identical. One clamp is meant to have M4 nut held captive, and the other end accepts the M4 screw. Place the other clamp one top, then you tighten the screw and the adapters clamp onto the hoses.

4.) After the tubing is clamped, thread M3 screws to secure the whole assembly into the Pump Adapter v2 mount. This pressed the tubing into the mounts.

5.) If you experience leakages, tighten all the screws. I found that the first culprit is the M3 screws holding the tubing assembly onto the pump mount.

6.) If these stopgap instructions are confusing, and I have not yet posted better ones, send an email to rkeesey@fordham.edu and we can chat. Also take a look the image. It might help a bit.
